                    <p>During my final year at the graduate school of engineering Polytech Sorbonne, I carried out an internship of six months at Softbank Robotics Europe. This international company created the robots Pepper (https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/pepper) and Nao (https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/nao).</p>

                    <p>My project's topic consisted of improving the interaction between Pepper and human by personalising its behaviours and speech for long-term interaction. This project sought to answer the main issue present in most of the interactions we can have with a humanoid robot: its repetitive behaviours resulting in the decreasing of user engagement.</p>

                    <p>Hence, a robot that could adapt its behaviours and speech to the user's personality, preferences, needs and share memories with the users, it would allow us to develop and enhance in a better way the social interactions we could have with robots. In this way, we illustrate the notion of "personalization" for companion robots.</p>

                    <p>Under the supervision of Bahar Irfan, PhD student at Plymouth University, and Alexandre Mazel, Innovation Director at Softbank Robotics Europe, I worked for six months in this project to personalize the behaviour and speech of the robot Pepper for goal-oriented dialogues.
                    We put the scenario of a barista robot, where Pepper had to take a customer's order. It also could remember regular customers and to propose them once again their regulars orders. For that purpose, we employed a multi-modal incremental Bayesian Network (*Irfan et al. 2018 "Multi-modal Open-Set Person Identification in HRI.") to recognize the users' identity. For the robot's speech, we used a rules-based dialog model built from scratch.</p>

                    <p>As part of the internship, a one-week experiment was carried out at Cit√© Universitaire (17 Boulevard Jourdan, 75014 Paris) to assess the overall project. A Late-Breaking Report about it was published at the HRI 2020 conference at Cambridge University, "Challenges of a Real-World HRI Study with Non-Native English Speakers: Can Personalisation Save the Day?" Bahar Irfan et al. 2020.</p>
